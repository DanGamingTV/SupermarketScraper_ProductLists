# SupermarketScraper Product ID Lists
This repo contains JSON files with product IDs, for use with SupermarketScraper.

Special note: the "freshchoice" entries will also be used for SuperValue. This is because both stores use MyFoodLink, and the product IDs will typically be the same. So put all IDs for MyFoodLink stores in the "freshchoice" array.
This is also the same for Paknsave and New World (Foodstuffs online). Their IDs are part of the same database, so put all IDs for Foodstuffs online into the "paknsave" array.
